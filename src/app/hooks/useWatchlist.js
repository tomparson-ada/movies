  // useEffect is a React hook that lets us specify code that is run immediately after rendering a component

    // We can now use setWatchList, the 'setter' function given to us by useState, since this is in scope in this component
    // setWatchlist accepts either a new value, or a callback which is passed the current value of watchlist
    // We can then update this value and set a new value using it
    // You might be tempted to do `setWatchlist([...watchlist, movie])` (i.e. to not use a callback and just pass a new value to setWatchlist)
    // but state isn't always update immediately and `watchlist` could contain an old version.
    // So by using the callback, we ensure that we're using a fresh version of `watchlist`
    //
    // *You should always use a callback when your new state needs to reference the value of the old state*
